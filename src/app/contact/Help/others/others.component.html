<h3><b>What if the size ordered by me, is too small or too big?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t worry; we will have it exchanged with the right size for your child.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>How long does the R&amp;E process take?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Return and Exchange process generally takes 7-10 working days and is subject to availability of stock.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>I have been trying to reach the Customer Support Number but there is no answer.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Customer Support team is available at your service, from </span><b>Monday to Saturday, 10:30hrs to 17:00hrs only.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All calls made after the service time, will be returned and tended to in the next 48 Working Hours.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>I have written an E-mail but there is no response or acknowledgement of receipt of my e-mail.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not believe in automating replies to Customers queries. Our Customer Support team generally reverts back to E-mail within 48hrs-72hrs on a personal level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, depending on the nature of your Case/Query, this may take longer. But please be rest assured, we will attend to you at the earliest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>How many lines does acecraft have for Customer Support?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">acecraft has 5 concurrent lines dedicated to every School, we service. This ensures every query is answered appropriately and effectively.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>Why were no measurements taken? / When will you come for measurements?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">acecraft conducts fitting trails at School only when there is a change in the Uniform sizing or in the Uniform patterns. This is done to ensure our Customers do not have any discrepancy in the transition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>Can we come to the School or acecraft Office for measurements?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">acecraft is an Online-based company and hence we do not have an arrangement for you to visit the School or Office for measurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">acecraft takes detailed steps to ensure we guide you in detail, in booking the right size for your Child’s Uniform.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>Why have you restricted it to only 2 uniforms? When can I buy more?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand of the School Uniform Industry is highly unpredictable as there is a drastic change in the proportion of sizes Year-on-Year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, to avoid a Demand/Supply mismatch, acecraft restricts buying of a few Products to a maximum of 2Nos/Size. Post the re-opening of the School in June, acecraft allows Customers to buy over 2Nos/Size.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereby, ensuring every student gets to wear a new pair of Uniforms on the first day of School.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
<h3><b>How do I order uniforms throughout the year?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Uniforms will be available Online. You could book them and get it delivered to your doorstep, within 7-10 working days.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br><br></span></p>
